# Guess-my-number-game
This is a basic game where the objective is to guess the hidden number within six attempts. If unsuccessful, the game stops, and the player needs to press the restart button to initiate a new game. In case of a win, the game updates the last score, turns the screen green, and automatically restarts after a 10-second interval.
